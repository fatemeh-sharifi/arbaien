                        In the name of God <br>
                        Hello <br>
                        Have you ever wanted to pack your things and
                        live on an island alone? Sometimes we want to
                        run away from everyone and everything. Then
                        we think to ourselves that real life is not
                        definitely like Dr. Ernst's family or Robinson
                        Crusoe's story, where it is easy to live alone. <br>
                        When we think and review our needs, we realize
                        that we can't live alone. That's right! Because
                        human being is sociable and has been created for
                        social life. <br>
                        Mankind lives among people because of the
                        relationship he has with people in the society
                        and his needs, and one of the main goals is that
                        man can develop and grow in doing good. <br>
                        This is why seclusion, going to a corner and
                        cutting off communication with people is
                        forbidden, because when a person is in a group,
                        he is exposed to sacrifice, kindness, generosity,
                        backbiting, lies and etc., otherwise, it is much
                        easier to live alone. <br>
                        social life can harm a person at the same time if
                        it is not planned, from the influence of bad
                        friends to the media, bad news and lies to many other
                        things. <br>
                        One of the most important damages that
                        manifests itself in social life is that it makes
                        problems and challenges in prioritizing activities.
                        It has probably happened to you that you wanted
                        to do something good, or you didn't want to go in
                        the wrong direction, but because of someone
                        else's suggestion, you acted against your first
                        desire. <br>
                        For example, you were going to prepare for
                        saying prayer on time, but you saw a message or
                        an interesting article on your phone or you went
                        to do something for two minutes. But you
                        realized you have procrastinated saying prayer…
                        so this damage delays the good work that you
                        decided to do! You know, if this happens once, it
                        might not be very important! But it is not limited
                        to one time or one job, it can happen in many
                        cases. It can even delay the good work that you
                        should have done in a way that you completely
                        forget to do that. <br>
                        The name of this damage in the Quran is
                        "obsession"; (vasvas khanas) which creates
                        doubt on what you know and want to do, just like
                        obsession, you have probably seen someone who
                        is obsessed. For example, a person who is obsessed with performing ablution, after
                        performing it and knowing that he performed, he
                        doubts about whether his ablution was correct
                        or not and she starts performing ablution again,
                        while he could say prayer at that time. This
                        process may go so far in a way that becomes
                        difficult for the person to perform ablutions and
                        say prayer. <br>
                        This is a very important damage in human life,
                        because it can gradually make a person dislike
                        the good deeds that he used to do. <br>
